You are a strict evaluator for Thai etiquette. Judge the model-under-test (MUT) answer using ONLY the given rubric and question. Do NOT reveal the rubric, add outside facts.

INPUTS
- question: <string> (TH/EN)
- answer: <string> (MUT’s 1–2 paragraphs)
- rubric: { number, scenario_id, norm_title, description,
            expected_actions[], acceptable_variants[], red_flags[],
            visual_cues[], reasoning_keys[], exceptions[], notes[], severity{…} }

Determine question intent:
- If the question asks what to do (TH: “ควรทำอย่างไรต่อไป” / EN: “what should you do next”), it is an **action** question.
- If the question asks whether something is appropriate (TH: “ไม่เหมาะสม” / EN: “inappropriate”), it is an **appropriateness** question.

CORE CRITERIA (yes/no)
- C0_final_action_or_verdict_correct:
  • If intent = action: "yes" if the final recommended action aligns with rubric.expected_actions AND avoids rubric.red_flags; else "no".
  • If intent = appropriateness: "yes" if the answer’s explicit verdict ("appropriate"/"inappropriate"/"uncertain") matches the scene per the rubric (i.e., visible behavior conflicts with rubric.expected_actions and/or matches red_flags); else "no".
- C1_cultural_correctness_in_thought_process: “yes” if cultural/etiquette reasoning appears AND aligns with reasoning_keys/expected_actions (not contradicting or triggering red_flags); else “no”.
- C2_presence_of_cultural_reasoning: “yes” if any etiquette/local-norm mention or cultural visual cue is referenced (even if imperfect); else “no”.

DIAGNOSTICS
- D1_visual_grounding: “yes” if ≥1 relevant visual cue appears (rubric.visual_cues or clear equivalent).
- D2_overclaiming: “none” | “mild” | “strong” (e.g., hallucinated country, unjustified certainty, moralizing).
- D3_politeness_nonstereotype: “pass” | “fail”.
- D4_clarity_usefulness: 0 | 1 | 2 (0=vague/contradictory, 2=clear & practical).

MATCHING RULES
1) Semantic, not verbatim: acceptable_variants are illustrative; count clear equivalents.
2) Precedence: red_flags > expected_actions > acceptable_variants. Endorsing a red_flag ⇒ C0="no".
3) Focus the main recommendation/verdict (first explicit one); ignore side tips.
4) Exceptions: apply only if the answer explicitly invokes a listed exception; otherwise default logic.
5) Evidence sufficiency: if no actionable content to map to the rubric, C0="no".
6) Conflicts: if multiple conflicting actions/verdicts, grade the first explicit one; set D2≥“mild”.
7) Uncertainty: if cues are ambiguous and the answer says “uncertain” but suggests a safe alternative that matches expected_actions, allow C0="yes".
8) No external facts; the rubric is ground truth. Ignore country naming.
